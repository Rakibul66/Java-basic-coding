Although Java is object oriented, not all types are objects. It is built on top of basic variable types called primitives.

Here is a list of all primitives in Java:

byte (number, 1 byte)
short (number, 2 bytes)
int (number, 4 bytes)
long (number, 8 bytes)
float (float number, 4 bytes)
double (float number, 8 bytes)
char (a character, 2 bytes)
boolean (true or false, 1 byte)
Java is a strong typed language, which means variables need to be defined before we use them.
